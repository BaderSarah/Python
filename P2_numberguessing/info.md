## Project 2 - number guessing

This code is a simple number guessing game. The program generates a random number between 0 and 20 and asks the user to guess it. If the user's guess is too high, it says "Too high!" If it's too low, it says "Too low!" If the user guesses correctly, it says "Correct!" and the game ends.
